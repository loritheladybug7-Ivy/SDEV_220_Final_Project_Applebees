<h1>Applebee's Recipe Box</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
This is our final project for SDEV 220 at Ivy Tech Community College. 
We are designing a program for Applebee's to organize their recipes.


The minimum requirements are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Contain a graphical user-friendly interface that interacts with a minimum of three classes.</li>
<li>Utilize collections such as lists, tuples, arrays, and dictionaries.</li>
<li>Run with no syntax or runtime errors and produce the correct results.</li>
<li>Include documenation of the class diagram, and a report of results with sample output.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges:</h3>
This is our first class that is completely in Python, and that means our skill levels are varied and on the lower side. 
Since we are early students, not everyone was great at recognizing their own strengths.
</p>
We initially had some trouble getting everyone connected to the online resources (GitHub and Trello/Kaban Board) but were able to work that out quickly. We have scaled back the app as initially we had included more features than required. Reducing the scope allowed us easily meet the deadline.
